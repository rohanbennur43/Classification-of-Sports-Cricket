# Classification of Sports - Cricket

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Capstone project focused on the classification of sports, with a primary focus on cricket. The project utilizes machine learning techniques, including CNN-LSTM with attention mechanisms, Random Forest, and SVM algorithms to achieve accurate and reliable classification results.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **src:** Jupyter notebooks containing the implementation and analysis of the CNN-LSTM model with attention, Random Forest, and SVM.
- **Webapp :** Contains the code for web app
- **Docs** Contains the nexessary documents

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. CNN-LSTM with Attention

- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for sequence modeling.
- Introduced an attention mechanism to enhance model performance.
- Achieved the best results among the models experimented with in this project.

### 2. Random Forest

- Employed the Random Forest algorithm for classification.
- Explored feature importance and ensemble learning techniques.

### 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Utilized Support Vector Machine for classification tasks.
- Explored the kernel trick and tuning parameters for optimal performance.
